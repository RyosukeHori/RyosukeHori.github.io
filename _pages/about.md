Hi, I am Ryosuke Hori (堀 涼介).

I am a PhD student at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Hideo Saito](https://www.st.keio.ac.jp/en/tprofile/ics/hideo.saito.html) since September 2022. I am also a research assistant at the [Digital Human Research Team](https://dhrt.notion.site/Digital-Human-Research-Team-AIRC-AIST-8d53e3c09734402092effc93f52eee6a), part of the [Artificial Intelligence Research Center](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/) at the [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://unit.aist.go.jp/ai/), where I work under Dr. Mitsunori Tada.

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the [Kris Kitani](https://kriskitani.github.io/) Lab in the Robotics Institute (RI) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am also a Research Fellow of the JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (DC1).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
