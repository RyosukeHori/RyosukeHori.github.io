Hi, I am Ryosuke Hori (堀 涼介).

I am a PhD student at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Hideo Saito](https://www.st.keio.ac.jp/en/tprofile/ics/hideo.saito.html) since September 2022. I am also a research assistant at the [Digital Human Research Team](https://dhrt.notion.site/Digital-Human-Research-Team-AIRC-AIST-8d53e3c09734402092effc93f52eee6a), part of the [Artificial Intelligence Research Center](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/) at the [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html), where I work under Dr. Mitsunori Tada. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the [Kris Kitani](https://kriskitani.github.io/) Lab in the Robotics Institute (RI) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am also a Research Fellow of the JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (DC1).
